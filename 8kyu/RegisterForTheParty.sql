/*
REGISTER FOR THE PARTY - SQL

You received an invitation to an amazing party. Now you need to write an insert statement to add
yourself to the table of participants.

== participants table schema ==
    name (string)
    age (integer)
    attending (boolean)

NOTES:

- Since alcohol will be served, you can only attend if you are 21 or older.
- You can't attend if the attending column returns anything but true.
- Don't remove the 'SELECT' command from the solution!
- Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.

INSERT INTO participants (name, age, attending)
VALUES ('John', 29, true);

SELECT * FROM participants;
